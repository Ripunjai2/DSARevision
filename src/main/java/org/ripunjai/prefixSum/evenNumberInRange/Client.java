/*
Problem:
You are given an array A of length N and Q queries given by the 2D array B of size QÃ—2.
Each query consists of two integers B[i][0] and B[i][1].
For every query, your task is to find the count of even numbers in the range from A[B[i][0]] to A[B[i][1]].


 Solution: We will use prefix sum approach and create a prefix array of even numbers count to solve this problem.
